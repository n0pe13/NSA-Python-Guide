I post my duckface you watch me true
I could only wish you'd double tap my
Selfie selfishly i must say i like you
You know my love for me cats and bow ties
My government touch or terrorist lace
On the way to my voyage you are kings
And queens to seams of every suitcase
Protect from us bombers in travel things

Thank you america god forbid that
The terrorists win or we legalize it
It's communism it's hippies it's fat
'Merica watch me touch me google it

For i cherish life in the land of the free
Happy as long as my government sees me
